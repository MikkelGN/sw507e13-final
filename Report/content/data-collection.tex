\chapter{Sensors \& Data Collection}\label{chapter:data-collection}
This chapter describes the measurement and collection of readings to determine the orientation of the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.
After determining the orientation of the accelerometer, additional data of the user movement is recorded.
Hereafter, the gyroscope and the magnetometer are described, and readings from these sensors are used to determine the angle of the device.
The data will be examined to determine how the movement of the user affects the acceleration.
