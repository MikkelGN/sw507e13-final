\section{Data logger}\label{section:datalogger}
All the data in this project has been logged, using a Nokia Lumia 820 running Windows Phone 8.
The data logger has been used to understand the output of the phone's different sensors.
It works by recording output from the accelerometer, the gyroscope, and the magnetometer, the collected data can then be sent to a web-service, which stores the data in a database.
To make sure that the data logger does not overburden the database with update-requests, all the sensor-data is stored locally, and sent to the web-service once recording is complete.
%The data is sent by a web client, and it is therefore possible to sent multiple data sets together.
The data has been sent through a web-service because Windows Phone 8 does not offer a framework which works directly with MySQL.
