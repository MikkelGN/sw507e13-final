\section{Limitations}\label{section:limitations}
As the development time is limited, some limitations have to be declared before the requirements are specified.
The application is limited by the sensors of the smartphone, what movements they are able to read, and how accurate the application is.
Another limitation is the implementation language for the application, which in this case is C\#.
The language restricts the platforms that can be used, but C\# is still a versatile language.

As mentioned in \secref{section:dead-reckoning}, dead reckoning is hard to implement, without some limitations of various forms, due to measurement uncertainties.
For this reason, limitations to how the user is allowed to operate the device has to be specified. 
To play the game, the user is limited to holding the smartphone in a fixed position in front of him, and has to look at the display.
Another limitation is how the user should move, which will be limited to left and right movement.

Another important limitation for this project is the allotted time, which is limited to a single semester. 
Having limited time, will not allow for the implementation of the application for multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, etc.
For this project the application will be developed for the \textit{Windows Phone 8} platform, using a \textit{Nokia Lumia 820}.
Nokia Lumia 820 provides the essential sensors for dead reckoning and does not limit the movements that can be registered.
