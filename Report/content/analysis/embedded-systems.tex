\section{Embedded Systems}
\label{section:embedded-systems}
Embedded systems have been used for over 40 years, one of the first microprocessor was developed by Intel in 1971, and was used for business calculators \citep{book:embedded-system}.
Embedded systems are found in almost every household electronic, which are used in people's everyday life.
They are, however, not restricted to household electronic, as they are used in industries.
An embedded system consists of hardware and software, which is designed to perform specific tasks.
Usually, this hardware is very restricted, in terms of memory, processing, and battery life.  
An example could be a coffee machine with a built-in timer function.
This timer will be an embedded system, which is a very restricted system as it does not require complex calculations and memory use.
While this is a very simple example, embedded systems can also be complex, such as in a smartphone or a car with multiple embedded systems that communicate amongst each other. 
Many embedded systems are real-time systems as they require immediate response, an example of this could be ABS in a car where response is needed immediately, as it would otherwise be a safety hazard rather than a safety function.
