\section{Problem Statement}\label{section:problemstatement}
After analysing the topics in the sections above, a problem statement can be declared. 
Systems already exists, which help people with their exercise, either by tracking various information about an exercise, or motivating them e.g. with a story. 
Most of these existing applications utilise GPS to track the users' exercise, while a few of them apply a dead reckoning technique that allows both indoor and outdoor exercises.
For that reason it is believed it would be beneficial to make a smartphone application that is not restricted to being outside.
This decision is chosen, since the amount of applications that offer indoor activities are limited, compared to the selection of GPS based applications.

With these previous sections in mind, a hypothesis can be stated:
\begin{center}
\textbf{A game that is fun and motivates the user to exercise can be developed for a smartphone using dead reckoning.}
\end{center}

To help verify this hypothesis, the following questions need to be answered:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What are the requirements for a smartphone application that make people want to exercise?
	\item How can a smartphone application motivate people to exercise?
	\item Why would people use this application instead of other applications?
\end{enumerate}
