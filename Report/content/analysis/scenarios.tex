\section{Scenarios}\label{section:scenarios}
In this section, examples of how this application can be used will be examined.
The areas that need to be examined are indoor and outdoor exercises.
There will be created two scenarios with the characters John and Brian.

\subsection{Indoor Exercise}

John has an office job where he spends most of his days sitting in a chair.
His work schedule is often full and therefore he rarely gets any exercise.
John acquires a new application which should help him with his exercise during his work schedule.
Every now and then he takes a short break from his work and by the help of the application he gets some exercise.
After using the application frequently, John feels much more energetic.

Brian requires some exercise because he is out of shape and obese.
Obesity is a problem for Brian as it is becoming a serious health issue.
Brian uses an application to start his exercise.
The application tracks his exercise and notifies him of his progress, which in turn motivates him to continue doing exercises.
Brian shares his progress with his friends, who then join him in his next exercise session.
After a couple of months of exercising, Brian has lost weight and his health situation has substantially improved.
