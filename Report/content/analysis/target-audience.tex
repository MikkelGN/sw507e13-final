\section{Target Audience}\label{section:targetaudience}
As previously mentioned in the introduction, \chapref{chapter:introduction}, this application is aimed at people who need to be motivated towards physical activity.
It is a broad audience and includes people who are obese or in need of regular physical activity.
A requirement is that they need a smartphone, which is a common device today.
The age range of the target audience ranges from young kids to middle aged people who like games.

Income can be ignored, as the the target audience is already limited to people who have a smartphone.
The application will not be aimed at a specific gender as obesity and the need of physical activity impacts both genders. 
Furthermore, smartphones are equally used by both genders \citep{misc:smartphoneuse}.
