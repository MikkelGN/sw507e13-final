\chapter{System Analysis}\label{chapter:system-analysis}
In this chapter the required components for the system are analysed. 
First a discussion of different motivation factors will be described, which gives a foundation for the system components.
The components include the tools which are used to create the game and the sensors which are essential for utilising dead reckoning.

Lastly, a system definition will be written using a FACTOR analysis, which is an Object-Oriented Analysis and Design tool \citep{book:OOAD}.
