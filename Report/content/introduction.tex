\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}
An increase in obesity and overweight has been reported in most parts of the world, which results in various problems, like health issues and government expenses \citep{misc:HealthRisks,misc:FedmeKoster}.
There are several reasons for this increase in obesity, e.g. an increase in fast-food consumption, lack of physical activity, and busy work schedules \citep{misc:WhatCausesOverweight,misc:TheLancet}. 
This problem requires a solution, since a lot of people are struggling with obesity and the consequences it causes \citep{misc:Folkesundhed}.

A tool to address this problem can be games, since they are fun and can, indirectly, make people exercise \citep{misc:gamemotivations}.
A platform for such games could be smartphones, as they are readily available \citep{misc:Onbile}. 
Smartphones have integrated sensors which can be used to track the physical movement of the user. 
The smartphone can detect small movements such as rotation, and movements over large areas can be tracked by GPS. 
An example of a game can be \textit{Cops and Robbers}, where the player is chased by other people or a virtual enemy. 
Another game can be \textit{Pong}, which requires less physical space to play, but where the user moves from side to side to control a paddle.

Since people have their smartphone with them, they can play a game to exercise during breaks at work, or after spending most of the day sitting in front of a desk. 
This game could track and motivate a person to jog or ride a bike from and to work. 
If people, by playing the game, would exercise more on a regular basis, it could help reduce the overweight problem.
