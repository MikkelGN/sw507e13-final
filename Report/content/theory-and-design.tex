\chapter{Theory \& Design}\label{chapter:theory-and-design}
In this chapter, the theory and design for this project will be described and specified.
The theory will cover position calculation techniques, Bayesian networks, and normal distribution.
Afterwards, the machine intelligence theories of this project are specified, game and system design will be reviewed using event tables, state diagrams, and illustrated concepts.
